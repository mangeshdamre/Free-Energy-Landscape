# Free-Energy-Plots

The free energy landscapes are very useful to interprete and analyse the biomolecular processes such as molecular folding, aggreagation and recognition. Molecule's free energy landscape can be calculated by the following formula

\
where __*k<sub>B</sub>*__ and __*T*__ are the Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature, respectively, and __*P(CV1,CV2)*__ is the probability distribution of the molecular system along the reaction coordinates/ collective variables (CV1 and CV2).
